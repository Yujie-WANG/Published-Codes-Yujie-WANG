## About

`ResearchProjects` includes all the currently in-progress projects Yujie Wang
    gets involved. The project is meant to use the latest Julia. The code for
    published papers were moved to [`Published-Codes-Yujie-WANG`][pub-url].
    Unpublished projects were moved to deprecated projects for future use
    (i.e., more investigation required).
