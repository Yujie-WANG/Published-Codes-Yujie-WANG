Note that the functions to plot figures use LaTex to render the text and math.
    Ensure that you have LaTex and necessary packages installed if you want to
    run the plotting functions directly. Otherwise, you need to remove the
    parts that uses LaTex renders, and you may identify them by searching `\$`
    in the code.

Steps to use the script
- install julia (best use Julia 1.6.1, which the code has been tested on)
- `cd` into the home directory of the project
- run `julia --project`
- type `]` in Julia promote to enter Pkg mode (run only at 1st time)
- type `instantiate` to install the dependencies (run only at 1st time)
- type BACKSPACE to go back to julia mode (run only at 1st time)
- within Julia promote, copy and paste the commands below

```julia
using ResearchProjects;
proj = ClumpingFactor2020{Float64}();
fit_leafbio(proj);
sif_simulation!(proj);
```

Note that you need to obtain the necessary data file and change the location
    folder path to run the `sif_simulation!` function. I don't have the
    permission to share others' data.
