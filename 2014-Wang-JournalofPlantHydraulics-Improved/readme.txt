About the software. You need such packages installed:
        VC++ 2010 Redistributable (x64), VC++ 2010 Redistributable (x86);
        VC++ 2012 Redistributable (x64), VC++ 2012 Redistributable (x86);
        VC++ 2013 Redistributable (x64), VC++ 2013 Redistributable (x86);
        Pylon Suite;
        Driver for your USB-to-RS232 / USB-to-RS485 cable.
The software should run okay once you have everything installed properly.

The VC++ Redistributable may not be installed by default, but you can be downloaded here: https://www.itechtics.com/microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-versions-direct-download-links/

Pylon version 4 should be used, but it is difficult to find on their website because they update it to version 5. I have Pylon 4 and the software on in the same folder, just install it at default directory?

I have not used the centrifuge for years. The software is re-compiled in 2018 and should run without any problem.

Note: in some versions, you must end the file name with .cam, otherwise the program crashes; in some versions, the program stops running after 2017. This uploaded version does not have such problems.
